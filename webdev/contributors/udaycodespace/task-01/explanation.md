## What I understood from this task
The goal of this task was to create a clean and responsive landing page
section using only HTML and CSS, with emphasis on semantic structure and
clarity rather than complex design.

## How I implemented the solution
I created a single section using semantic elements like section, header,
and article to keep the structure readable. I used CSS variables to
maintain a consistent theme and applied Flexbox-like spacing concepts
through margin and layout control. A simple CSS animation was added to
create a subtle page-load effect.

## What I learned
This task helped me understand how small decisions in typography, spacing,
and color impact readability. I also learned how to create visual depth
without relying on external libraries or heavy styling.

## What is good about my solution
The HTML structure is easy to follow, the design remains consistent
throughout, and the layout adapts properly on smaller screens.

## What could be improved
The section could be extended with additional content blocks or refined
typography choices to improve visual hierarchy further.

## Other thoughts
Focusing on structure and intent instead of decoration made this task
more meaningful and closer to real-world frontend work.
