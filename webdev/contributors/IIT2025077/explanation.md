## Explain What This Code Does
This code makes a Landing Page for TechTonic-2.0.It contains 3 Different sections:-
About
Features
Why TechTonic
At the top there is header wchich contains Title TechTonic in h1 tag;
In About section I have used paragraph tags for content and h2 tag for heading
In Features Section h2 tag is used for heading and h3 tag for subheadings. All the div tags used for different features have a border with some predefined border-radius and width.
h1,h2,h3 are used for different sizing of headings.
Why Techtonic section is also same as features section just i have used article tags rather than div as mentioned in issue.
different shades of blue color is used to make the flow consistent.
