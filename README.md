## 🌿 Wing-Wise Branch Structure

TechTonic follows a **branch-based wing system**:

| Wing | Branch |
|-----|------|
| Web Development | `webdev` |
| App Development | `appdev` |
| AI / ML | `aiml` |
| Design | `design` |
| CC Wing | `competitive` |
| Cybersec | `cybersec` |
| Blockchain | `blockchain` |
| Game Development | `gamedev` |
| FOSS | `foss` |

Each branch will have:

- 4–5 beginner-friendly issues  
- Starter project code  
- Wing-specific instructions  

> ⚠️ The `main` branch does not contain project code.  
> All development must happen inside your respective wing branch.
